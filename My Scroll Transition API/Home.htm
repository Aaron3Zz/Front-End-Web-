                    The capybara[a] or greater capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) <br>
                    is a giant cavy rodent native to South America. It is the largest 
                    living rodent[2] and a member of the genus Hydrochoerus. The only <br>
                    other extant member is the lesser capybara (Hydrochoerus isthmius).
                    Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, and it is <br>
                    more distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the nutria. 
                    The capybara inhabits savannas and dense forests, and lives near bodies <br>
                    of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as 
                    large as 100 individuals, but usually live in groups of 10-20 individuals.

                    In the early 2020s, capybaras became a growing figure of meme culture due
                    to many factors, including the disturbances in Nordelta which <br>
                    led to them being comically postulated as figures of class struggle. Also, a common 
                    meme format includes capybaras in various situations <br> 
                    with the song "After Party" by Don Toliver, leading to a tremendous growth in popularity. 
                    Due to a lyric in Toliver's song, capybaras <br>
                    are also associated with the phrase "Ok I pull up".
